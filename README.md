# ðŸš€ React + Vite

Alright, listen up - I'm supposed to write a README but... you know how it is.

This is a **tiny, simple** project.
So small, in fact, that you don't even need instructions.
If you know how to open terminal, you'll be just fine.

### What's inside?

- **React + Vite** - because speed matters
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** - because manually refreshing the page is so 2015
- **Some ESLint Rules** - just enough to make you feel guilty about ignoring them

## How to run?

You already know:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enjoy! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
